In this section, we present how to connect Twelve Labs API to MindsDB.

[Twelve Labs](https://twelvelabs.io/product
) provides a powerful and seamless video search infrastructure for your application. 

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

 1. Install MindsDB on your system or obtain access to cloud options.
 2. To use Twelve Labs with MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).
 3. Copy your Twelve Labs API Key by navigating to the [Dashboard page](https://api.twelvelabs.io/dashboard).

## AI Engine

The first step to use this handler is to create an ML Engine. The required argument to create the engine is:

* `api_key` - The TweleveLabs api key. 

Once you copy the api_key you can establish a connection by executing the following SQL command:

```sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE twelve_labs_engine
FROM twelve_labs
USING
  api_key = '<YOUR_API_KEY>';
```

## AI Model

Now, you can use this ML Engine to create Models for the different tasks supported by the handler. 

When executing the `CREATE MODEL` statement, the following parameters are supported in the `USING` clause of the query:
- `engine`: The name of the ML Engine to use. This is a required parameter.
- `api_key`: The Twelve Labs API key to use for authentication. This is a required parameter.
- `task`: The task to perform. This is a required parameter and must be one of `search` or `classification`.
- `index_name`: The name of the index to use; if it does not exist, it will be created. This is a required parameter. More information about indexes can be found [here](https://docs.twelvelabs.io/docs/create-indexes).
- `index_options`: A list of the types of information within the video that will be processed by the video understanding engine. This is a required parameter and can be any combination of `visual`, `conversation`, `text_in_video` and `logo`. More information about index options can be found [here](https://docs.twelvelabs.io/docs/indexing-options).
- `video_urls`: A list of URLs to the videos to be indexed. This is an optional parameter, but if not specified, one of `video_files`, `video_urls_col` or `video_files_col` must be specified instead.
- `video_files`: A list of local paths to the videos to be indexed. This is an optional parameter, but if not specified, one of `video_urls`, `video_urls_col` or `video_files_col` must be specified instead.
- `video_urls_col`: The name of the column containing the URLs to the videos to be indexed. This is an optional parameter, but if not specified, one of `video_urls`, `video_files` or `video_files_col` must be specified instead.
- `video_files_col`: The name of the column containing the local paths to the videos to be indexed. This is an optional parameter, but if not specified, one of `video_urls`, `video_files` or `video_urls_col` must be specified instead.
- `search_options`: A list of the sources of information to use when performing a search. This parameter is required if the `task` is `search` and it should be a subset of `index_options`. More information about search options can be found [here](https://docs.twelvelabs.io/docs/search-options).

Given below are examples of creating Models for each of the supported tasks.

### Search

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.twelve_labs_search
PREDICT search_results
USING
  engine = 'twelve_labs_engine',
  api_key = '<YOUR_API_KEY>',
  task = 'search',
  index_name = 'index_1',
  index_options = ['visual', 'conversation', 'text_in_video', 'logo'],
  video_urls = ['https://.../video_1.mp4', 'https://.../video_2.mp4'],
  search_options = ['visual', 'conversation', 'text_in_video', 'logo'],
  query_column = 'query'
```

As mentioned above, the `search_options` parameter is specific to the `search` task and should be a subset of `index_options`.

## Making Predictions

Once you have created a Model, you can use it to make predictions. 

Given below are examples of making predictions using Models created for each of the supported tasks.

### Usage

Use the `twelve_labs_search` model to query the video as:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mindsdb.twelve_labs_search
WHERE query = 'search query';
```

Here, the `query` column is a required parameter and should contain the search query.

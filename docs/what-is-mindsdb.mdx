title: MindsDB - Middleware for Building Custom AI
sidebarTitle: Introduction
---

MindsDB is the middleware for building custom AI, enabling smarter organizations.  

We believe AI will help every company thrive, but off-the-shelf, generic AI usually doesn’t completely meet their needs. With MindsDB’s nearly 200 integrations, any developer can create AI customized for their purpose, faster and more securely. Their AI systems will constantly improve themselves — using companies’ own data, in real-time.

## Concepts

| | |
|------------|------------|
| [AI Tables](/ai-engines/overview) | One of MindsDB's innovations is the ability to treat AI ([MODELS](/model-types), [AGENTS](/agents/agent), [KNOWLEDGE BASES](/agents/knowledge-bases)) as [virtual tables](/generative-ai-tables) that you can [SELECT FROM](/sql/get-single-prediction), [JOIN](/sql/get-batch-predictions), and [FINE-TUNE](/sql/api/finetune) from any datasource using any [AI-Engine](/ai-engines/overview). |
| [Data Sources](/datasources/overview) | Connect any data to MindsDB, ths server then excels at translating SQL queries into requests that can access and combine data from a wide range of sources, including [Databases](/datasources/overview#databases), [Applications](/datasources/overview#applications), [Vector stores](/datasources/overview#vector-databases), and much more. |
| [Automation](/sql/create/jobs) | You can automate tasks with [JOBS](/sql/create/jobs) in MindsDB, by scheduling any query, at whatever frequency, or by using [TRIGGERS](/sql/create/trigger). |

<Tip>
<strong>Why MindsDB?</strong> MindsDB enhances SQL, which is an effective declarative language for data manipulation. It's also an ideal foundation for constructing <strong>data-centric AI</strong>.

## Use Cases

Here are some AI/LLM use cases:
      - [Fine-Tune](sql/api/finetune#example-3-openai-model)
      - [Knowledge bases](/agents/knowledge-bases)
      - [Agents](/agents/agent)
      - [Chatbots](/sql/tutorials/twitterbot-mariadb-enterprise-server-skysql)
      - [Classification](/nlp/nlp-extended-examples#text-classification)
      - [Sentiment Analysis](/nlp/sentiment-analysis-inside-mysql-with-openai)
      - [Summarisation](/nlp/text-summarization-inside-mysql-with-openai)
      - [Translation](/nlp/nlp-extended-examples#translation)
      - [RAG/Semantic Search](/integrations/ai-engines/rag)
      - [Q&A](/nlp/question-answering-inside-mysql-with-openai)

You can use MindsDB for the following Machine Learning use cases:
      - [Anomaly Detection](/integrations/ai-engines/anomaly)
      - [Forecasting](/sql/tutorials/eeg-forecasting)
      - [Recommenders](sql/tutorials/recommenders)
      - [Classification](/sql/tutorials/customer-churn)
      - [Regression](/sql/tutorials/home-rentals)

And for the following multi-media use cases:
      - [Video Semantic Search](/integrations/ai-engines/twelvelabs)
      - [Text Semantic Search](/integrations/ai-engines/replicate-img2text)
      - [Text to Audio](/integrations/ai-engines/replicate-audio)
      - [Text to Video](/integrations/ai-engines/replicate-text2video)
      - [Text to Image](/integrations/ai-engines/replicate-text2img)

You can use one of MindsDB’s AutoMLs or you can bring your own, pre-trained model.

## Sample AI Workflow

We can automate any workflow end-to-end using MindsDB’s Jobs command.

</p>

There are many tutorials that you can follow to see the full workflows in action. 

For example: AI workflow featuring integrations with [Binance](/integrations/app-integrations/binance) (our data source), [TimeGPT](/integrations/ai-engines/timegpt) (our forecasting model), and [Slack](/integrations/app-integrations/slack) (where we’ll publish the outputs from the forecasting model). In this scenario, you can seamlessly retrieve real-time trading data from Binance, utilize it as input for a TimeGPT model to generate forecasts, and receive these forecasts as Slack notifications.
